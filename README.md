# BrandProductSentiment
## Overview
Deep learning model, which predicts whether tweet is negative, neutral or positive. You can test is on a single custom  
tweet or paste just Your own csv which constains number of tweets. As the result You will get a percentage score of  
sentiments of the tweets so You can get an intuition what other people think about Your company, product, etc.

## Deployment
It is deployed only on localhost with flask. So if You want to try it You have to clone this repo.



# Note
It is a quiet old project, so the code style is not the greatest for sure. Keep that in mind :)
